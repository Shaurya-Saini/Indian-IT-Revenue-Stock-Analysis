# Indian IT Companies: Revenue vs. Stock Price Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between **revenue growth** and **stock price movements** for five Indian IT companies—**TCS**, **Infosys**, **Wipro**, **Persistent Systems**, and **Mphasis**—from **2014 to 2024**. It explores:
1. How revenue growth impacts stock performance.
2. The influence of global events (e.g., COVID-19, economic slowdowns) on IT stock prices.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Revenue data from annual reports; stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance` and web scraping.
- **Analysis**: Correlation between revenue growth and stock returns; impact of global events.
- **Visualization**: Graphs (line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
- **Conclusions**: Actionable insights and recommendations for investors and IT companies.
